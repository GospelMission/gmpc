      <h1>GOSPEL MISSION CHURCH(GMC) MISSION AND VISION</h1>
      <h2>Our Mission Statement – “Win, Build, Send” </h2>
      <p>We believe that our relationship with God is illustrated by the Great Commandment found in Matthew 22:37-40.  This commandment is summarized with the statement “Loving God, Loving People.”</p>
      
      <h3>The Great Commandment</h3>
      <p>“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…Love your neighbour as yourself.  All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.” – Matthew 22:37-40</p>
      <p>The Great Commission brings the Great Commandment into clearer focus by indicating our “neighbour” is represented by all peoples of the earth.</p>
    
      <h3>The Great Commission</h3>
      <p>“Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”  - Matthew 28:19-20</p>
      <p>We hold the chief purpose of the church is to glorify God (Romans 15:5; I Corinthians 6:20) through a commitment to three kingdom-building principles found in His Word (Matthew 28:18-20).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Winning people to Christ.</li>
        <li>Building each believer into a disciple of Christ.</li>
        <li>Sending mature believers back into the world to reach those not yet won.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our mission statement can thus be summarized as – “Win, Build, Send, all to the glory of God.” </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>In order to fulfil the mission of “Win, Build, Send”, our vision for the next five to ten years contains the following priorities.</p>
      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>We envision our church as a canter for prayer in our region (NCR), where prayer is an everyday activity.  We believe prayer is vital to the accomplishment of God’s will in our church, our community and world.  We promote prayer as a lifestyle for every believer.</p>
    
      <p>Our vision for prayer, energized by the Holy Spirit, includes asking God to fill us with </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A prayer life that seeks to authentically connect us to Christ and includes confession and repentance!</li>
        <li>A larger vision of Christ, to see Him for all He is!</li>
        <li>A renewed hope and passion for a greater fellowship with Christ!</li>
        <li>A new stream of revival in our barangay, city, country and world!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our Prayer Partners, Pastors, and Intercessors serve as champions for prayer, and they communicate the power of prayer among our members and friends.</p>
      
      <h3>Worship</h3>
      <p>We envision seeking ways to promote worship that are thoughtful, passionate, creative, and practical.  We were created to worship God and offer our worship as an act of love and obedience.  This type of worship brings pleasure to God.  We offer worship services that are diversified.  Our goal is that worship will become a practical part of everything we do.</p>
      
      <h3>Fellowship</h3>
      <p>We envision a church characterized by deep and meaningful fellowship where people encourage one another in the great hope of our faith.  We define fellowship as “loving God’s family” and we promote it by encouraging membership, friendship and partnership.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Membership – We place a high value on church membership, and we will educate people to see the value that comes from belonging to a church family. </li>
        <li>Friendship – We encourage each of our members to establish close-knit friendships with others in the church family.  We will promote small groups as one key place these needed friendships can develop and grow.</li>
        <li>Partnership – We encourage people to become partners in the ministry.  One aspect of this includes people working together in the ministries of our church.  In addition, we will also partner regionally and internationally with other churches and organizations of like-minded faith. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Discipleship</h3>
      <p>We envision a church where we are committed to the full spiritual development of one another.   Examples of these opportunities include children’s programs, our Basic Growth Seminars, small groups, Sunday School, student ministries, leadership training, and 7x 7 discipleship strategy.  Our goal is to develop believers that are energized and guided by the Holy Spirit and more Christ-like in character.  </p>
      
      <h3>Ministry</h3>
      <p>We envision a church where every member actively ministers according to their gifts and abilities.  We will offer frequent training that allows people to develop their gifts and grow in their service.  We actively and regularly make service opportunities available.  By involving every member in ministry, we will meet not only the needs of those in our church family, but we will also seek opportunities to minister to those in our community and the world.</p>
    
      <h3>Evangelism</h3>
      <p>We envision a church where every member is trained to make evangelism a lifestyle.  We will offer these training opportunities regularly.  We will plan periodic evangelism events designed to attract non-Christians.  Because we know lost people matter to God, we make a high commitment to local, regional, and international missions.  We will schedule short-term mission opportunities and attend regular mission conferences.  We will cultivate vocational missionaries.</p>
    
      <h3>Facility</h3>
      <p>We envision a facility that is welcoming, comfortable, and effective for the various ministries of our church.  This facility will accommodate growth in our Sunday morning worship attendance (increasing an opportunity for evangelism) and it will facilitate spiritual growth (discipleship) by effectively supporting our Christian Education programs.  To accomplish this, we will pray of building a new, larger facility.  A larger facility would permit the entire church family to gather together at one time.  This facility will provide sufficient space for classrooms, fellowship, staff offices, parking, storage, and prayer.</p>
